# Project TJ-JPT

## Release Date
TBD

## Introduction
As a pentester, there are many great resources, cheat sheets, and guidelines that contain a large amount of valuable 
information. However, it can be frustrating and time-consuming to find these notes or resources that are scattered all 
over the place. Not to mention the large amount of notes you have stored locally across your system with several 
different note-taking tools. In addition, some pentesters could be in assessments that are in a closed environment 
making it more challenging to transfer there notes and files on their devices. That's when I found [Joplin][Joplin] 
to be able to suit my needs when I am on engagements.

## Features with Joplin:
- Notes can be searchable, copied, tagged, and modified either from the applications directly or from your text editor.
- Markdown Editor and Reader. Easy to import and export notes to multiple formats. 
- [WebClipper][WebClipper] to save web pages and screenshot from Firefox and Chrome Browser
- Sync notes on various cloud applications such as NextCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive
- Sync notes on a local file share or WebDav. 
- Compatible to work on Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android

## What does the template include?
- Command line references.
- Personal notes that I left as reminders when I am assessing a target.
- PWK Report in Markdown (Can be exported into a `PDF`)

**NOTE:** You must have Joplin installed on your system.
1. Open Joplin

## Feedback, Suggestions and Contributions
Although this template is just the start there can always be room to add new tips, resources, or guides for other 
people to use in this template. Feel free to post any suggestions that you may have or want to include by submitting 
an issue in the repo.
